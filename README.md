# Swift Operating System / Kernel
A powerful kernel and operating system that operates on ROBLOX games. Open source and very secure, built by the community.

Good for games / projects that have to manage a lot of GUI's, Swift OS's simple user interface makes dealing with game GUI's a lot easier.

Totally free (yes I said that on purpose!)

# Difference between kernel and operating system
Swift is built upon a unique kernel, although we give it out with the operating system built over it, developers can use the Swift kernel to create their own modifications of it and/or use it in a more advanced fashion in projects.
